#Machine Learning - Decision Tree Classifier
In this notebook, we explore the use of decision tree classifier for a Network Intrusion detection use case. The data set used is from KDD cup 1999.

The dataset is a version from the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program by MIT Lincoln Labs. The draw TCP dump ata was collected from a LAN in a lab environment over nine weeks. Simulated attacks were performed to generate malicious traffic.

Attacks could be classified into four main categories:

DOS: denial-of-service R2L: Remote to Local - unauthorized access from a remote machine U2R: User to Root probing: surveillance and other probing like port scanning.
